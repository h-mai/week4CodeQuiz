User Story: 

AS A coding bootcamp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

Functionality and Features: 

On the start screen, the user will be prompted to start the quiz

When the quiz starts a series of 5 questions will appear, all with 4 different answers to select from. 

The rules are that the user will have 90 seconds to finish the quiz - which is displayed on the top right hand corner of the page.

With each answer selected the application will display an 'incorrect' or 'correct' prompt underneath the series of questions.

For any incorrect answers the user will be penalised 10 seconds off their timer score. 

When the quiz is complete the user will be given an 'All Done!' prompt with their final score and how many questions they got right. 

The user will be then be able to enter their initals and submit their score in to be recorded on the highscores page. 

This data will be stored on the users local storage on their browser.

After serveral attempts at the quiz the user will be able to collate a list of scores to compare with one another.

The option is there to also clear the score list and start fresh - this will also clear the data in the local storage. 

If the user chooses not to clear the data, it will be held in local storage and will keep rendering new records. The user will also be able to click on to the 'View Highscores' in this case and view previous users scores.
